# Seed

Plugin apply to **[MCDR-v1.x](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged)**, reforged from **[Seed](https://github.com/MCDReforged/Seed)** of **[White_Paper](https://github.com/AngelicaRoot)**.  

Use command `!!seed` to get seed of server, apply to server that disabled op permission but published seed (such as most of **vanilla survival** server).  

Need server to enable **RCON** connection, reply a **vanilla-like** message (with `hoverEvent` and `clickEvent`).
